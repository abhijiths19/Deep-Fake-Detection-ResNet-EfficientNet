model_resnet50_efficientnet_weights.h5 - this file is required to run this correctly. I couldnt upload this file due to size limitations. 
Therefore I have created a Google Drive Link and have uploaded it there. You can access the file via

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XbdhcmzZF95khGdv96JCukGeeJp6HiQ2/view?usp=sharing

Paste the file along with the other files and run the code.

I have also added a video on how it works. Check it out through:
